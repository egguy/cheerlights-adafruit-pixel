An quick, hacky, ugly and working implementation of the #cheerlight projects protocol adapted for the ws2801 pixel by adafruit

Should work with other similar chips

You can use the included python script to pipe a twitter stream with stdin

ex: curl -d "tracking=#cheerlights" https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json -uAnyTwitterUser:Password | python cheerlights.py > /dev/ttyUSB0

Adapt for your environment
